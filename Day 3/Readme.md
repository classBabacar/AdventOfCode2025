Very interesting problem, this problem solved by a monotonic stack (a stack that is either in increasing or decreasing order), the small caveat to this is that you are only allowed N amount of removals which you need to keep track of.

There is a leetcode problem that really explains the strength of this algorithm: https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/
